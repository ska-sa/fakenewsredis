fakenewsredis: A fake version of a redis-py
===========================================

fakenewsredis was originally forked from fakeredis_. The author is now a
fakeredis maintainer, and all future development will be done on fakeredis. If
you are using fakenewsredis, you should switch back to fakeredis_.

fakenewsredis will be kept online to avoid breaking existing code,
but will simply import all functionality from fakeredis.
